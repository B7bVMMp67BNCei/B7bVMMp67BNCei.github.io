This is a mirror of Matrix web clients.

## What is Matrix?

Matrix is a open and federated protocol for instant messaging (think of it like Discord) with a variety of software built on top of it.

## Which client app should I use?

Both Element and Cinny are client apps for Matrix, and they both do the same thing fundementally, but:

- Only Cinny supports sending custom emojis
- Only Element supports voice and video calls

...but most importantly:

- The Element UI is a lot simpler and easier-to-use than the Cinny UI.

Because of those, you should just use both clients at once, and switch between them depending on what features you want to use.

## !!! IMPORTANT: BACKING UP YOUR SECURITY KEY !!!

**DO NOT** use Cinny to create your account, as it does not appear to have a way to export the security key. Use Element for that instead.

After creating your account with Element, Go to Settings (the icon at the bottom left) -> All settings -> Security & Privacy and then follow the Secure Backup instructions to download your security key.

Every time you log in again, you will need to use your security key to gain access to your encrypted conversations.

In Element, it will prompt you to enter it as soon as you sign in.

However, for Cinny you will need to do the following:

- Click the Security button, which is above the Settings button at the bottom left corner and below the Search icon.
- Scroll down to Unverified sessions, find the session that says Current (it should be the first one on the list), and click Verify.
- Enter your security key when it prompts you for it.
- Profit.
